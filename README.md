TicTacToe
=======

I originally made this TicTacToe game to satisfy the MVC-Game assignment in the pair columbus exercises.

Now, I'm reading through Sandi Metz's Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby, and the idea is to use this project as the 'lab' accompanying the 'lecture' of the book.  After every chapter, I'll rework the project to satisfy the ideals identified in that chapter.

Each version is kept present, to emphasize that this is a work in progress, and emphasize the hard lines between each chapter.  (No going back and changing things!)

V0 is something like my best shot before starting the book.  It could stand to have a lot more unit testing.  And I have some anxieties about the controller structure especially - it would be more rails-like to have maybe controller controlling the action overall, and a second set of controllers controlling the views that appear.  We'll see if these changes get done later.
